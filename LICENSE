Ekubo DAO Shared Revenue License 1.0
(“Ekubo-DAO-SRL-1.0”)

Copyright (c) 2025
Ekubo, Inc., a Delaware corporation (“Ekubo, Inc.”)
and
Ekubo DAO, the decentralized community of EKUBO token holders acting through governance smart contracts (“Ekubo DAO”).

Permission is hereby granted, free of charge, to any person or entity obtaining a copy of this software and associated documentation files (the “Licensed Work”), to use, copy, modify, merge, publish, distribute, and deploy the Licensed Work, and to permit persons to whom the Licensed Work is furnished to do so, **subject to the conditions set forth below**.

This license is a custom open source license that **requires revenue sharing** with Ekubo DAO when the Licensed Work or any Derivative Work generates Protocol Revenue (as defined below).

1. Definitions

1.1 “Licensed Work” means the Ekubo automated market maker smart contract source code, any related interfaces or ABIs, and any accompanying documentation provided under this license.

1.2 “Licensor” means, collectively, Ekubo, Inc. and Ekubo DAO.

1.3 “Licensee” means any person or entity that exercises any permission granted by this license, including by using, copying, modifying, distributing, deploying, or creating Derivative Works of the Licensed Work.

1.4 “Derivative Work” means any work of authorship or software (including smart contracts) that is derived from, based on, or incorporates any portion of the Licensed Work or its ABI, or is deployed using or built on top of an **Official Deployment** of the Licensed Work, and that collects Protocol Revenue. For avoidance of doubt, (a) any contract that uses any portion of the Licensed Work’s source code or ABI, or (b) any contract deployed to extend, integrate with, or build atop an Official Deployment in a manner that collects Protocol Revenue, is a Derivative Work.

1.5 “Protocol Revenue” means any on-chain tokens or other assets that a smart contract collects as fees, rewards, or other revenue that are **not under the direct control of end users or depositors** (e.g., protocol fees, performance fees, retained spreads, or other value accrued to the contract, its operator, or its treasury).

1.6 “Protocol Revenue Share” means **fifty percent (50%) of all Protocol Revenue** generated by Licensee’s use, deployment, or distribution of the Licensed Work or any Derivative Work.

1.7 “Official Deployment” means any deployment of the Licensed Work to a blockchain designated by Licensor as an official/core deployment of the Ekubo protocol.

1.8 “Ekubo DAO’s Designated Address” means the on-chain address (or smart contract) designated by Ekubo DAO via governance vote to receive Protocol Revenue Share payments. Unless and until changed by the DAO, the DAO’s treasury or governance contract address shall serve as the Designated Address.

2. Grant of Rights; No Other Restrictions

2.1 Subject to Licensee’s continued compliance with this license, including the Revenue Sharing Obligation in Section 3, Licensor grants Licensee a worldwide, perpetual, non-exclusive, no-charge, royalty-free (except for the Protocol Revenue Share) license to use, copy, modify, distribute, and deploy the Licensed Work and Derivative Works for any purpose, including commercial purposes.

2.2 There are **no field-of-use restrictions** and no obligation to open-source Derivative Works solely by reason of using this license. However, any distribution of the Licensed Work or a Derivative Work must be under this same license as provided in Section 2.3.

2.3 Redistribution and Sublicensing. Any distribution, publication, or conveyance of the Licensed Work or a Derivative Work must include this license (or a link to it) and retain all copyright notices. Licensee may sublicense only on the terms of this license. Any attempt to relicense under terms that remove or diminish the Protocol Revenue Share is void.

3. Revenue Sharing Obligation

3.1 Obligation. If Licensee deploys, uses, or distributes the Licensed Work or any Derivative Work in a manner that generates Protocol Revenue, Licensee shall pay the Protocol Revenue Share—**50% of all Protocol Revenue**—to Ekubo DAO.

3.2 Timing; Method. Unless Ekubo DAO sets a different schedule or mechanism via governance, Licensee shall remit the Protocol Revenue Share **at least quarterly** by on-chain transfer to Ekubo DAO’s Designated Address. If no Designated Address or mechanism has been specified, Licensee shall hold the owed share **in trust** for Ekubo DAO and shall promptly seek DAO instruction (e.g., via governance processes) on where and how to remit payment.

3.3 No Circumvention. Licensee shall not structure transactions to evade Section 3 (e.g., diverting fees to intermediaries or changing fee semantics) where value is in substance Protocol Revenue.

3.4 DAO Governance. Ekubo DAO may, through governance vote, designate or change the receiving address, set operational details for payments, or clarify the definition of Protocol Revenue for novel cases on a prospective basis. The 50% share is fixed for this license version.

4. Compliance; Termination; Reinstatement

4.1 Acceptance. By exercising any rights under this license, Licensee accepts and agrees to be bound by its terms.

4.2 Automatic Termination. Any material breach—including failure to timely pay the Protocol Revenue Share—**automatically terminates** this license as to the breaching Licensee as of the date of breach. Upon termination, Licensee must cease all use, deployment, and distribution of the Licensed Work and any Derivative Works. Continued use after termination infringes Licensor’s rights.

4.3 Cure; Reinstatement. Licensor may, in its discretion, reinstate the license if Licensee cures the breach within 30 days of discovery (including full payment of amounts due, plus any reasonable interest or penalties set by DAO governance) and provides reasonable assurances against future breaches.

4.4 Downstream Use. Licensee must ensure downstream recipients are bound to this license. Where a downstream party generates Protocol Revenue using a Derivative Work distributed by Licensee, Licensee shall ensure the downstream party pays the Protocol Revenue Share directly or, failing that, account for and remit such amounts itself.

5. Ownership; Trademarks; Patents

5.1 Ownership. Except for the rights expressly granted, Licensor reserves all rights in the Licensed Work. Licensee owns its modifications subject to Licensor’s underlying rights and this license.

5.2 Trademarks. This license does not grant rights to use Ekubo, Inc. or Ekubo DAO names, logos, or trademarks, except as necessary and truthful to identify origin.

5.3 Patents. To the extent Licensor owns any patents necessarily infringed by using the Licensed Work as provided, Licensor grants a non-exclusive, worldwide, royalty-free patent license to practice such claims in connection with the Licensed Work and Derivative Works, conditioned on compliance with this license. This patent license terminates with the license if this license terminates.

6. Disclaimer of Warranties

THE LICENSED WORK IS PROVIDED “AS IS” AND “WITH ALL FAULTS,” WITHOUT WARRANTY OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING WITHOUT LIMITATION WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY, FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE, NON-INFRINGEMENT, SECURITY, OR THAT OPERATION WILL BE UNINTERRUPTED OR ERROR-FREE. USE OF SMART CONTRACTS ENTAILS INHERENT RISKS.

7. Limitation of Liability

TO THE MAXIMUM EXTENT PERMITTED BY LAW, IN NO EVENT SHALL LICENSOR OR ITS CONTRIBUTORS BE LIABLE FOR ANY DIRECT, INDIRECT, SPECIAL, INCIDENTAL, CONSEQUENTIAL, EXEMPLARY, OR PUNITIVE DAMAGES (INCLUDING LOSS OF PROFITS, GOODWILL, DATA, OR BUSINESS INTERRUPTION) ARISING OUT OF OR IN CONNECTION WITH THE LICENSED WORK OR THIS LICENSE, EVEN IF ADVISED OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH DAMAGES.

8. Governing Law; Venue

Except where prohibited, this license is governed by the laws of the State of Delaware, USA, excluding its conflict-of-laws rules. Licensee consents to jurisdiction and venue in the state and federal courts located in Delaware for disputes arising out of this license; provided that Ekubo DAO may, in its discretion, bring claims in another competent forum where necessary.

9. Severability; No Waiver

If any provision of this license is held invalid or unenforceable, it shall be enforced to the maximum extent permissible and the remaining provisions shall remain in full force. No waiver of any provision shall be effective unless in writing and signed or adopted via DAO governance; any failure to enforce is not a waiver.

10. Third-Party Beneficiary

Ekubo DAO is an express third-party beneficiary of Sections 3 and 4 and may enforce those obligations directly. Ekubo, Inc. also has standing to enforce this license.

11. Entire Agreement; Amendments; Versions

This license constitutes the entire agreement concerning the Licensed Work between Licensor and Licensee. Substantive changes (including any change to the 50% share) require issuance of a new license version by Ekubo, Inc. and/or Ekubo DAO. Ekubo DAO may issue prospective operational guidance (e.g., Designated Address) via governance. Licensee’s continued use after adoption of a new version signifies acceptance; otherwise, Licensee may continue under this version if compliant.

12. Notices

All notices to Ekubo, Inc. should be directed to its then-current contact channels. Notices to Ekubo DAO relating to payments or governance should be made through the DAO’s publicly designated governance forums or processes. On-chain memos should, where feasible, reference the project and period covered.
