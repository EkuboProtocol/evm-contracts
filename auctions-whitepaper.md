# Auctions Whitepaper

## Purpose

An auction in Ekubo is designed to do two things at once:

1. Raise funds for a new token launch.
2. Bootstrap healthy liquidity after the sale ends.

The mechanism is meant to be fair, transparent, and simple for participants to understand.

## How The Auction Works

An auction creator chooses a sale window and starts selling tokens over time.
Instead of a one-block sale, buyers can join at any point during the window.

Participants who want to buy can enter with a time-based buy order, adjust it, stop it, or collect their purchase results as the sale runs.
This makes participation flexible instead of all-or-nothing.

The seller can add more inventory to the same auction before it starts.
Once the sale is underway, the sale itself is not cancelable.
That rule exists to reduce discretion and improve trust for buyers.

## What Happens When The Sale Ends

After the auction ends, anyone can finalize it.
Finalization does two things:

1. Separates the seller's proceeds.
2. Sends a portion of value into a post-sale liquidity boost.

This means the auction is not only about selling tokens.
It also helps the market transition into deeper trading conditions after launch.

## Creator Proceeds

Creator proceeds are withdrawable by the auction controller.
They can be collected in parts or all at once, and can be sent to a chosen recipient.

This gives teams operational flexibility without weakening auction fairness.

## Liquidity Bootstrapping

A share of the completed auction value is routed into incentives for a designated pool.
The intent is to support liquidity immediately after launch, rather than leaving post-sale trading unsupported.

In practical terms, the auction does not end at fundraising.
It continues into market bootstrapping.

## Design Goals

- Fairness: no mid-sale cancellation of the auction schedule.
- Openness: anyone can participate during the sale window.
- Flexibility: participants can manage their own buy flow over time.
- Reliable completion: anyone can finalize after end time.
- Better post-launch markets: auction value can fund liquidity incentives.

## Why This Structure

Many launches optimize only for initial distribution.
Ekubo auctions are structured to optimize both distribution and the first phase of market quality.

By combining fundraising and liquidity bootstrapping in one flow, the mechanism aims to produce launches that are:

- easier to trust,
- easier to participate in,
- and better prepared for real trading after day one.
